For each iteration you should answer the following:

What user stories were completed this iteration?

Updated these:

*Login to account
*Implement Login restrictions
*Open Checkings Account
*Withdraw from Account
*Deposit into Account
*Have history tracked
*Pull recent history


What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

Implement:

*Integrate accessing history + permissions
*Open Multiple accounts 
*Implement more types of accounts
*Display Information
*(I'm sure once/as we finish those we'll find something pressing)


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

We're still working on merging everything - but the classes and their respective tests work and are successful.

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (please provide a script that users can run to launch your program)?


We haven't merged everything cohesively yet, but once we do, it should be just running the file, and then answering the according user prompts.
